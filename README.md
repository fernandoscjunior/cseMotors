## About this repo
In this repo lies my project for the CSE340 course of BYU-Idaho, where I learned the fundamentals of back-end programming with node, pnpm, ejs and express.
It is a website for selling used cars, it idealizes many common web practices such as CRUD, Database manipulation with a view, MVC architecture and others.
*for now only the source code is available, the website is not functional since it uses many shenanigans so it wouldn't work in github pages*
